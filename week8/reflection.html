    <h1>Reflection assignment</h1>
    <p> Something that i found different about functional programming as opposed to just html and css is the amount of terms and concepts that are possible. Using new concepts like node and creating simulation games, showed me how interactive and particular web development can really be. i learned new terms like array and string, which were terms that i hae had before but not applied to web development. In the beginning of this course I was finding it difficult to manage the substantial increase in the course workload. I managed to deal with this by making a scheldule for all the task I needed to complete in that week. For example, i would start my learn it assignments on monday and so on. My favorite part of this course was the simulation game and being able to show some creativity in how i wanted my game to go. </p>
